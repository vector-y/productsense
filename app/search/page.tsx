						<p>
							These three platforms reveal distinct philosophies for helping users find what they want.
							<strong> Netflix guides users toward recommended content</strong> through algorithmic curation and visual discovery patterns,
							optimizing for engagement time through personalized "For You" feeds and category browsing.
							<strong> YouTube prioritizes user control</strong> with a prominent search-first interface, voice input, and substantial filtering options,
							while still surfacing algorithmic suggestions on the home feed where most engagement happens.
							<strong> Airbnb flips the model</strong> by putting structured user agency first, with beautifully designed filters for Where/When/Who
							that empower users to convert interest directly into bookings.
						</p>
						<p>
							The fundamental tension across all three: how much to <em>guide</em> versus how much to <em>empower</em>?
							Netflix assumes users want recommendations and fine-tunes their suggestions.
							YouTube supports users who may search, browse, or follow creators across all three modes.
							Airbnb assumes users have clear needs and need tools to express them confidently.
							Each reflects its business model: engagement time, ad inventory, and conversion confidence.
